Add movies you would like to watch to your To-Watch list and track your already watched movies. 

App uses 3 different data sources:
- OMDB - where we get movie ratings
- TMDB - where we get movie info, popular list, similar movies
- Local database - where we store only your To-Watch List and Watched movies

This project is not finished - **still in development**. Not ready for daily use just for testing.

### To do:
- ~~new movie profile screen, better motion layout header~~
- various bug fixes
- adding tv series with episode list 
- support for different screen sizes
- ~~movie profile screen upgrades~~
- better UI/UX

- optimisation
- splash screen
